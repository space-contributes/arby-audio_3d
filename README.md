## ❓ Why Arby Audio?

Arby Audio goes beyond standard audio engines by simulating **real-world acoustics** in virtual spaces:

* **Room Geometry & Reflections** – Sound bounces naturally off virtual walls, ceilings, and objects.
* **Detects Virtual Objects** - Sound bounces off naturally over virtual objects detected in the scene
* **Sound Bounces** - with a delay (for realism) to reach the object and bounce off it.
* **Distance-Based Time Delays** – Delays replicate real-world propagation for precise spatialization.
* **Frequency-Dependent Low-Pass Filtering** – Simulates material absorption and air damping.
* **Advanced Speaker Mapping** – Supports 7.1.4 layouts (7 speakers down, 4 up, 1 subwoofer).
* **Binaural Downmix** – Optimized for headphone playback with immersive depth.
* **Trajectory Simulation** – Sound sources move dynamically along realistic paths.
* **Furniture & Environment Scanning** – Audio interacts intelligently with room objects.
* **Automatic Normalization** – Prevents clipping and ensures consistent output.
* **High-Fidelity Audio** – 96kHz, 32-bit audio quality—nearly 4× industry standard for movies.
* **Open Source** – Fully transparent and customizable.

🎮 **Living sound that bounces, adapts, and reacts. Not just heard, but felt. Smart room scaling brings audio to life.**
