Arby Audio delivers **cinematic-grade 3D sound** with immersive **7.1.4 spatial audio**.
Enjoy **living sound that reacts in real time**, bringing games, movies, and music to life with **natural reflections, precise positioning, and stunning binaural effects**.

## ‚ùì Arby Audio vs the typical system

### üé¨ The typical system

* Maps sound objects as virtual waves with delays and reflections.
* Provides 360¬∞ surround immersion.
* Default quality: **42kHz / 24-bit\***
* Adaptive spatial realism across devices.
* Widely adopted in theaters and consumer hardware.

\* depends on system configuration

### üéÆ Arby Audio

**Living sound that bounces, adapts, and reacts. Not just heard, but felt. Smart room scaling brings audio to life.**

#  Reflections, furniture occlusion, immersive realism‚Äîwithout any sensors, cameras, microphones. Mind = blown. ü§Ø

Arby Audio pushes beyond traditional audio engines with **real-world acoustic simulation**:

* Room geometry & reflections
* Distance-based and sound wave bouncing time delays
* Frequency-dependent low-pass filtering, if bounced (sound wave if bounced, less frequency) + clipping for random high frequency audio
* Background noise reduction
* Speaker mapping to **7.1.4 layout** (7 down, 4 up, 1 sub)
* Binaural downmix for headphones
* Trajectory-based moving sound sources
* Furniture/environment scanning for realistic reflections
* Automatic normalization & high-frequency smoothing
* **High-fidelity output**: 96kHz / 32-bit (‚âà4√ó industry standard)
* Fully **open source & customizable**

## üîç Feature Breakdown

* **Room Geometry & Reflections** ‚Äì Sound bounces naturally off virtual walls, ceilings, and objects.
* **Virtual Object Detection** ‚Äì Sounds interact with detected scene objects.
* **Realistic Delays** ‚Äì Travel & reflection delays modeled after real physics.
* **Material-Aware Filtering** ‚Äì Simulates absorption & air damping.
* **Speaker Mapping** ‚Äì True 7.1.4 Atmos-style layout.
* **Binaural Downmix** ‚Äì Immersive stereo playback.
* **Background Noise Removal** - Removes background noise
* **Dynamic Trajectories** ‚Äì Moving sources with path realism.
* **Environment Scanning** ‚Äì Furniture/objects intelligently shape reflections.
* **Clipping Protection** ‚Äì Auto-normalization ensures stable output.
* **Room Geometry & Reflections** ‚Äì Sound bounces naturally off virtual walls, ceilings, and objects.
* **Detects Virtual Objects** - Sound bounces off naturally over virtual objects detected in the scene
* **Sound Bounces** - with a delay (for realism) to reach the object and bounce off it.
* **Distance-Based Time Delays** ‚Äì Delays replicate real-world propagation for precise spatialization.
* **Frequency-Dependent Low-Pass Filtering** ‚Äì Simulates material absorption and air damping.
* **Studio-Grade Fidelity** ‚Äì 96kHz / 32-bit audio. (‚âà4√ó the industry standard)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Usage

Clone or download the repo: or download the releases (the latest one)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/space-code/arby-audio_3d.git
cd arby-audio_3d
```
OR: DOWNLOAD FIELS INDUVISUALLY (PYTHON OR HTML, YOU CHOOSE):
HTML:
Open the file in a browser.
Python:
Run the engine with your audio file:

```bash
python "PYTHONSCRIPT.py" --music_url https://your-music-url.com/file.wav
```
OR: DOWNLOAD THE FILES INDIVIDUALLY through the GitHub website


*(replace with your own .wav URL)*

## OR, FOR WINDOWS:
Still requires cloning the repo or downloading files individually from the GitHub website.
Run the WOO.BAT as administrator.
Then, if it gets stuck, restart it.
If it is not processing the .WAV, try shortening the URL using tinyurl.com and try again with the updated link.

# FOR MACOS AND LINUX:

or .WOO.sh for Linux OR MacOS file as root/sudo/su.
For .sh:
chmod +x WOO.sh && sudo ./WOO.sh
Then, if it gets stuck, restart it. If it were to be stuck on Python installation, confirm Python is installed by a command, and then restart WOO.sh, because sometimes it forgets that Python is done installing.

## üîÆ Roadmap

* Google Drive integration
* GUI front-end for non-technical users
* Expanded VR/AR SDK support
