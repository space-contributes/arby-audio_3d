## ❓ Arby Audio vs Dolby Atmos

### 🎬 Dolby Atmos

* Maps sound objects as virtual waves with delays and reflections.
* Provides 360° surround immersion.
* Default quality: **42kHz / 24-bit\***
* Adaptive spatial realism across devices.
* Widely adopted in theaters and consumer hardware.

\* depends on system configuration

### 🎮 Arby Audio

**Living sound that bounces, adapts, and reacts. Not just heard, but felt. Smart room scaling brings audio to life.**

Arby Audio pushes beyond traditional audio engines with **real-world acoustic simulation**:

* Room geometry & reflections
* Distance-based and sound wave bouncing time delays
* Frequency-dependent low-pass filtering, if bounced (sound wave if bounced, less frequency) + clipping for random high frequency audio
* Background noise reduction
* Speaker mapping to **7.1.4 layout** (7 down, 4 up, 1 sub)
* Binaural downmix for headphones
* Trajectory-based moving sound sources
* Furniture/environment scanning for realistic reflections
* Automatic normalization & high-frequency smoothing
* **High-fidelity output**: 96kHz / 32-bit (≈4× industry standard)
* Fully **open source & customizable**

## 🔍 Feature Breakdown

* **Room Geometry & Reflections** – Sound bounces naturally off virtual walls, ceilings, and objects.
* **Virtual Object Detection** – Sounds interact with detected scene objects.
* **Realistic Delays** – Travel & reflection delays modeled after real physics.
* **Material-Aware Filtering** – Simulates absorption & air damping.
* **Speaker Mapping** – True 7.1.4 Atmos-style layout.
* **Binaural Downmix** – Immersive stereo playback.
* **Background Noise Removal** - Removes background noise
* **Dynamic Trajectories** – Moving sources with path realism.
* **Environment Scanning** – Furniture/objects intelligently shape reflections.
* **Clipping Protection** – Auto-normalization ensures stable output.
* **Room Geometry & Reflections** – Sound bounces naturally off virtual walls, ceilings, and objects.
* **Detects Virtual Objects** - Sound bounces off naturally over virtual objects detected in the scene
* **Sound Bounces** - with a delay (for realism) to reach the object and bounce off it.
* **Distance-Based Time Delays** – Delays replicate real-world propagation for precise spatialization.
* **Frequency-Dependent Low-Pass Filtering** – Simulates material absorption and air damping.
* **Studio-Grade Fidelity** – 96kHz / 32-bit audio. (≈4× the industry standard)
