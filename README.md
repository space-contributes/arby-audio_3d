## ‚ùì Arby Audio vs. Dolby Atmos
### Dolby:

Dolby Atmos is an advanced audio technology that:

* Maps virtual objects as sound waves to bounce, reflect, delay for reflection, delay to reach the virtual object, and bounce back. These delays are for enhancedrealism.
* 360 surround sound
* 42KHZ, 24BIT by default*
* Spatial realism by adapting to various spaces
* Widely used*

# Arby Audio: üéÆ **Living sound that bounces, adapts, and reacts. Not just heard, but felt. Smart room scaling brings audio to life.**

Arby Audio goes beyond standard audio engines by simulating **real-world acoustics** in virtual spaces:
* Room geometry & reflections  
* Distance-based time delays  
* Frequency-dependent low-pass filtering  
* Speaker mapping to 7.1.4 layout (7 speakers down, 4 speakers up, 1 subwoofer right there\!)  
* Binaural downmix  
* Trajectory simulation  
* Furniture/environment scanning for realistic reflections  
* Automatic normalization and a lowpass filter to remove high or sudden frequencies beyond normal high frequency effects
* Nearly 4x the industry standard for movies (in terms of quality): 96KHZ, 32BIT Audio  
* Open Source

* üéÆ **Living sound that bounces, adapts, and reacts. Not just heard, but felt. Smart room scaling brings audio to life.**

# More complex breakdown:


* **Room Geometry & Reflections** ‚Äì Sound bounces naturally off virtual walls, ceilings, and objects.
* **Detects Virtual Objects** - Sound bounces off naturally over virtual objects detected in the scene
* **Sound Bounces** - with a delay (for realism) to reach the object and bounce off it.
* **Distance-Based Time Delays** ‚Äì Delays replicate real-world propagation for precise spatialization.
* **Frequency-Dependent Low-Pass Filtering** ‚Äì Simulates material absorption and air damping.
* **Lowpass Filter for High frequencies** - Removes high or sudden frequencies beyond normal high frequency effects
* **Advanced Speaker Mapping** ‚Äì Supports 7.1.4 layouts (7 speakers down, 4 up, 1 subwoofer).
* **Binaural Downmix** ‚Äì Optimized for headphone playback with immersive depth.
* **Trajectory Simulation** ‚Äì Sound sources move dynamically along realistic paths.
* **Furniture & Environment Scanning** ‚Äì Audio interacts intelligently with room objects.
* **Automatic Normalization** ‚Äì Prevents clipping and ensures consistent output.
* **High-Fidelity Audio** ‚Äì 96kHz, 32-bit audio quality‚Äînearly 4√ó industry standard for movies.
* **Open Source** ‚Äì Fully transparent and customizable.
